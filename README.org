* Atreus Keyboard

The [[http://ergodox.org][Ergodox]] keyboard is an absolutely fantastic design; I use it every
day at my office. However, I like to work from coffee shops and other
locations frequently, and I thought I might try my hand at designing
something a little more portable. The great thing about assembling
my Ergodox is that it taught be there's really nothing magical about
it; it's just a piece of circuitry with a bunch of switches read by a
microcontroller that speaks the USB HID interface.

The Atreus is meant to be complementary to the Ergodox as something
smaller, cheaper, and more travel-friendly. The case measures 25x11cm
and lacks even a number row, relying heavily upon the fn key. There is
no PCB in this design, requiring [[http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/brownfox-step-by-step-t6050.html][a manual matrix wiring approach]].
However, given that there are only 4 rows and 10 columns, this isn't
as daunting as it could be.

** Layout

See [[file:layout.txt][layout.txt]] for the key positions. Only a handful of punctuation
marks (and no digits) available unshifted, and all the modifiers are
on the bottom row.

I type in Dvorak but prefer to do the remapping in software rather than
hardware so I don't have to change layouts when I switch to my
laptop's internal keyboard.

** Parts

*** Switches

I strongly prefer the feel and sound of [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MX1A-E1NW/CH197-ND/20180][Cherry MX blue]] switches for typing.

However, I like having linear switches on the modifier keys (ctrl,
alt, super, shift, and fn). [[http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keyboard-parts/cherry-mx-red-keyswitch-mx1a-l1nn-linear.html][Cherry MX red switches]] are nice and light
but are difficult to find. Cherry black switches are cheaper and
easier to source, but may be too heavy, especially for keys under
pinky fingers.

This layout has five modifiers and 35 non-modifiers.

*** Diodes

In order to avoid ghosting, each switch needs a [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/1N4148TR/1N4148FSTR-ND/458811][diode]].

*** Microcontroller

I'll be using a Teensy 3 since I have one on hand, but an [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1315][Arduino
Micro]] or [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html][Teensy 2]] would work too.

*** Keycaps

This [[http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/product/dsa-pbt-blank-sets][DSA-shaped base set]] has 52 1x keys plus a few extras we won't use.

** Case

Layered laser-cut acrylic; see [[file:case.svg][case.svg]]. 2mm for the bottom layer, 6mm for the others.
