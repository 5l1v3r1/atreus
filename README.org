* Atreus Keyboard

The [[http://ergodox.org][Ergodox]] keyboard is an absolutely fantastic design; I use it every
day at my office. However, I like to work away from the office
frequently, and I thought I might try my hand at designing something a
little more portable. The great thing about assembling my Ergodox is
that it taught be there's really nothing magical about it; it's just a
piece of circuitry with a bunch of switches read by a microcontroller
that speaks the USB HID interface.

The Atreus is meant to be complementary to the Ergodox as something
smaller, cheaper, and more travel-friendly. The case measures 25x11cm
and lacks even a number row, relying heavily upon the fn key. There is
no PCB in this design, requiring [[http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/brownfox-step-by-step-t6050.html][a manual matrix wiring approach]].
However, given that there are only 4 rows and 10 columns, this isn't
as daunting as it could be. It also allows for quicker iteration on
design changes since alterations only require cutting a new case.

I've seen a number of existing DIY 40% keyboard designs, but most of
them stagger the rows, which I find very annoying now that I've gotten
used to the columnar layout of the Ergodox. In addition, many of the
designs I've seen waste a lot of room on the space bar, failing to
take into account the fact that the thumb is the strongest and most
versatile of the fingers. This design avoids both these problems.

** Layout

Only a handful of punctuation marks (and no digits) available
unshifted, and all the modifiers are on the bottom row.

 :    q     w     e     r     t       ||         y     u     i     o    p
 :    a     s     d     f     g       ||         h     j     k     l    ;
 :    z     x     c     v     b       ||         n     m     ,     .    /
 :  shift  super tab  bksp  ctrl  fn  || space  alt  enter  esc  pgup  pgdn

The numbers and most punctuation are on the fn layer:

 :    1     2     3     4    5        ||         6     7     8     9    0
 :    !     @     #     $    %        ||         ^     &     *     (    )
 :    _     -     =     +    /        ||         ?     {     }     [    ]
 :          ~           \             ||    `

I type in Dvorak but prefer to do the remapping in software rather than
hardware so I don't have to change layouts when I switch to my
laptop's internal keyboard.

** Parts

*** Switches

This layout has five modifiers and 37 non-modifiers.

I strongly prefer the feel and sound of tactile [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MX1A-E1NW/CH197-ND/20180][Cherry MX blue]]
switches for typing. However, I like having linear switches on the
modifier keys (ctrl, alt, super, shift, and fn). [[http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keyboard-parts/cherry-mx-red-keyswitch-mx1a-l1nn-linear.html][Cherry MX red
switches]] are nice and light but are expensive and difficult to
find. [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MX1A-11NW/CH160-ND/91134][Cherry MX black switches]] are cheaper and easier to source, but
may be too heavy, especially for keys under pinky fingers.

One trick is take the springs from some of your blue switches and
trade them with the springs from your black switches. The blacks then
become the equivalent of reds, and the blues become MX green switches,
which are a heavier variant of blues. These are typically used for
space bars on boards that otherwise use blues. They could be suitable
for non-modifier thumb keys.

**** Recommended switch types for bottom row
- shift: red
- super: red
- tab: blue
- bksp: green
- ctrl: black
- fn: black
- space: green
- alt: black
- enter: blue
- esc: blue
- page up: blue
- page down: blue

If you don't bother with the spring replacement step mentioned above,
use blues instead of greens and blacks instead of reds. Or just use
whatever switches you want; it's your board!

*** Diodes

In order to avoid ghosting, each switch needs a [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/1N4148TR/1N4148FSTR-ND/458811][diode]].

*** Microcontroller

I'll be using a Teensy 3 since I have one on hand, but an [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1315][Arduino
Micro]] or [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html][Teensy 2]] would work too.

*** Keycaps

This [[http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/product/dsa-pbt-blank-sets][DSA-shaped base set]] has 52 1x keys plus a few extras we won't use.

** Case

Layered laser-cut acrylic; see [[file:case.svg][case.svg]].

The first two shapes in the case file are the top and bottom covers;
these should be cut on 3mm acrylic. The third is the spacer that goes
under the fourth, which is the plate on which the switches are
mounted. These should be cut in 5mm or 6mm acrylic.
