* Atreus Keyboard

The Atreus is a mechanical keyboard designed primarily to match the
shape of human hands and to be as portable as possible. The case
measures 25x11cm and lacks even a number row, relying heavily upon the
fn key. There is no PCB in this design, requiring [[http://wiki.geekhack.org/index.php?title=Hard-Wiring_How-To][a manual matrix
wiring approach]]. However, given that there are only 4 rows and 11
columns, the wiring process isn't as daunting as it could be.

I've seen a number of existing DIY 40% keyboard designs, but most of
them stagger the rows, which I find very annoying now that I've gotten
used to the columnar layout of the [[http://ergodox.org][Ergodox]]. In addition, many of the
designs I've seen waste a lot of room on the space bar, failing to
take into account the fact that the thumb is the strongest and most
versatile of the fingers. This design avoids both these problems while
taking a more couch-friendly single-piece approach.

** Kits

You can buy [[http://atreus.technomancy.us][Atreus kits]] that have all the parts you need along with
detailed assembly instructions from http://atreus.technomancy.us. If
you'd rather round up all the parts yourself, that's possible too
since the design is completely open source; see the bill of materials
below.

** Layout

Only a handful of punctuation marks (and no digits) are available
unshifted, and all the modifiers are on the bottom row:

 :    q     w     e     r     t       ||       y     u     i     o    p
 :    a     s     d     f     g       ||       h     j     k     l    ;
 :    z     x     c     v     b       ||       n     m     ,     .    /
 :   esc   tab  super shift bksp ctrl || alt space  fn     -     '  enter

The numbers and most of the punctuation are on the fn layer with a
numpad-style arrangement under the right hand:

 :    !     @     {     }     |       ||     pgup    7     8     9    *
 :    #     $     (     )     `       ||     pgdn    4     5     6    +
 :    %     ^     [     ]     ~       ||       \     1     2     3    ?
 :   L2  insert                       ||                   .     0    =

The =L2= key switches it to the function layer, and tapping =fn= here
brings it back.

The firmware project includes a number of other options, including
colemak, dvorak, and "software dvorak" which sends keycodes assuming
the OS will perform the translation into dvorak. Adding new layouts or
changing existing ones is easy.

** Parts

*** Switches

This layout has five modifiers and 37 non-modifiers.

I strongly prefer the feel and sound of tactile [[http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=651][Cherry MX blue]]
switches for typing. However, I like having linear [[http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=103][Cherry MX black
switches]] switches on the modifier keys (ctrl, alt, super, shift, and
fn) because the tactile effect has no benefit for keys that are held
down, and giving a different response helps you learn the layout more
quickly.

*** Diodes

In order to avoid ghosting, each switch needs a [[https://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062587][1N4148 diode]].

*** Microcontroller

A [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html][Teensy 2]], [[http://www.pololu.com/product/3101][Pololu A-star micro]], or [[http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMicro][Arduino Micro]] is recommended.

Be sure to get one without headers so it will fit in between the
bottom layer and the plate. USB micro is preferred over USB mini for
this reason as well.

*** Keycaps

This [[http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/product/dsa-pbt-blank-sets][DSA-shaped base set]] (spherical indentations on the key, same
profile for each row) from Signature Plastics has 52 1x keys plus a
few extras we won't use. There are two "deep dish" keys in that set
which you can place under your index fingers on the home row to help
guide your hands to the right spot without looking. However, you only
get a single 1.5x keycap, and the middle two thumb keys both use them,
so you might want to pick up an extra. You can buy a single DSA 1.5x
keycap from [[http://www.keycapsdirect.com/key-capsinventory.php][Signature Plastics]] as well as keys with homing bumps if
you prefer those to the deep dish keys for the keys under the index
fingers. However, note that on a board as small as the Atreus, finding
the home row is much easier than it is on a conventional keyboard.

** Case

Layered laser-cut wood or acrylic. The original case (=case-mk-i.svg=)
is slightly less wide and has a minor asymmetry with the screws on the
bottom side. The [[http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic%3D54759.msg1304117#msg1304117][mark II case]] (in the =case= directory) is implemented
programmatically in openscad, though dxf files are available as a
convenience, which can be converted to SVG or EPS for laser cutting
with Inkscape. Mark II features 8 screw holes and a kind of "stair
step" design around the top and bottom of the key clusters; mark I is
pictured below.

[[./layers.jpg]]

The bottom and top covers (black in the photo) should be cut in 3mm.
The switch plate (frosted in the photo) can be cut in 4.5 or
3mm. The spacer should be cut in 5 or 6mm; it needs to be at least as
thick as the USB cable you connect to the microcontroller. I
recommend using a USB cable with as thin a connector as you can
find or sanding the connector down to the required thickness.

TODO: describe finishing process for wood.

** Firmware

The [[https://gitlab.com/technomancy/atreus-firmware/blob/master/readme.md][custom Atreus firmware]] is a small C project which
implements matrix scanning and debouncing with user-customizeable
layers and macro functions. Another option is the much more complex
TMK firmware. My [[https://github.com/technomancy/tmk_keyboard/tree/atreus][fork of the tmk firmware]] has support for the Atreus
layout. You should be able to change into the =keyboard/atreus=
directory and run =make KEYMAP=atreus= (or whichever variant you want)
to produce a qwerty =atreus.hex= file. You will probably want to
create your own layout once you've gotten a chance to try it and see
what works for you.

In either case you would use the =.hex= file you just produced with
=avrdude= or the [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html][teensy loader]] to upload to the microcontroller.

Once the firmware is loaded and the keyboard is assembled, pressing
the onboard reset button to update new versions of the firmware is
pretty cumbersome; instead use the "reset" button on the layout, which
has the same effect.

** Bill of Materials

- 50 MX Blue switches: $29.00 (mechanicalkeyboards.com)
- 50 diodes: $3.45 (radio shack, should be able to buy in-person)
- Base blank DSA keycap set: $23.00 (signatureplastics.com)
- Teensy 2: $16, $3 shipping (pjrc.com)
- Acrylic materials: ~$16, varies by source
- Acrylic laser cutting: 7.5 minutes on a 100W Epilog laser; varies by source
- USB Mini-B cable: $5, various sources

Recommended but optional:

- 5 MX Black switches: $8.50 OR 5 MX Red switches: $10.00
- additional 1.5x DSA keycap: $1 plus $8 shipping

The base keycap set only has one 1.5x key, which is used for the inner
thumb keys. You can use a 1x key for one of them, but it looks kind of
tacky, so I recommend getting a second 1.5x keycap separately.

*** Other Tools

You'll need a soldering iron, solder, a glue gun, a multimeter, hookup
wire, and wire strippers. You'll also need eight M3 machine screws
with nuts; the length of the screws depends on the thickness of the
acrylic you use. You can add rubber feet to the bottom to prevent the
board from sliding around when placed on a desk.

** Orestes

A new [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/14654421878][experimental build]] uses the [[http://pjrc.com/store/teensy31.html][Teensy 3]] microcontroller and
[[https://github.com/technomancy/orestes/tree/teensy3][Forth-based]] firmware, but this is not yet suitable for general-purpose use.
