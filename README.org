* Atreus Keyboard

The [[http://ergodox.org][Ergodox]] keyboard is an absolutely fantastic design; I use it every
day at my office. However, I like to work away from the office
frequently, and I thought I might try my hand at designing something a
little more portable. The great thing about assembling my Ergodox is
that it taught be there's really nothing magical about it; it's just a
piece of circuitry with a bunch of switches read by a microcontroller
that speaks the USB HID interface.

The Atreus is meant to be complementary to the Ergodox as something
smaller, cheaper, and more travel-friendly. The case measures 25x11cm
and lacks even a number row, relying heavily upon the fn key. There is
no PCB in this design, requiring [[http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/brownfox-step-by-step-t6050.html][a manual matrix wiring approach]].
However, given that there are only 4 rows and 10 columns, this isn't
as daunting as it could be. It also allows for quicker iteration on
design changes since alterations only require cutting a new case.

I've seen a number of existing DIY 40% keyboard designs, but all of
them stagger the rows, which I find very annoying now that I've gotten
used to the columnar layout of the Ergodox. In addition, all the
designs I've seen waste a lot of room on the space bar, failing to
take into account the fact that the thumb is the strongest and most
versatile of the fingers. This design avoids both these problems.

** Layout

Only a handful of punctuation marks (and no digits) available
unshifted, and all the modifiers are on the bottom row.

 :    q     w     e     r     t   ||   y     u     i     o    p
 :    a     s     d     f     g   ||   h     j     k     l    ;
 :    z     x     c     v     b   ||   n     m     ,     .    /
 :  shift  tab  super ctrl  bksp  || space  alt  enter  esc  fn

The numbers and most punctuation are on the fn layer:

 :    1     2     3     4    5    ||   6     7     8     9    0
 :    !     @     #     $    %    ||   ^     &     *     (    )
 :    _     -     =     +    /    ||   ?     {     }     [    ]
 :          ~                \    ||   `         pgup   pgdn

I type in Dvorak but prefer to do the remapping in software rather than
hardware so I don't have to change layouts when I switch to my
laptop's internal keyboard.

** Parts

*** Switches

I strongly prefer the feel and sound of tactile [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MX1A-E1NW/CH197-ND/20180][Cherry MX blue]]
switches for typing.

However, I like having linear switches on the modifier keys (ctrl,
alt, super, shift, and fn). [[http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keyboard-parts/cherry-mx-red-keyswitch-mx1a-l1nn-linear.html][Cherry MX red switches]] are nice and light
but are difficult to find. Cherry black switches are cheaper and
easier to source, but may be too heavy, especially for keys under
pinky fingers.

This layout has five modifiers and 35 non-modifiers.

*** Diodes

In order to avoid ghosting, each switch needs a [[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/1N4148TR/1N4148FSTR-ND/458811][diode]].

*** Microcontroller

I'll be using a Teensy 3 since I have one on hand, but an [[https://www.adafruit.com/products/1315][Arduino
Micro]] or [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html][Teensy 2]] would work too.

*** Keycaps

This [[http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/product/dsa-pbt-blank-sets][DSA-shaped base set]] has 52 1x keys plus a few extras we won't use.

** Case

Layered laser-cut acrylic; see [[file:case.svg][case.svg]]. 2mm for the bottom and top
layers, 6mm for the others.
